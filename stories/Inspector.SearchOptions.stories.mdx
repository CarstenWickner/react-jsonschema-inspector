----

### default
By default, a search field is being offered in the top right corner. It searches on the displayed item names as well on the "title" and "description" fields of the respective JSON Schema.
If a search term has been entered, items that are matching themselves or contain matching (nested) items are being highlighted.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="default">
        <Inspector
            schemas={{
                Person: personSchema,
                Shop: shopSelectionSchema
            }}
            defaultSelectedItems={["Shop", "inventory", "[0]"]}
            // these are the default props (i.e. same as if you leave them out)
            searchOptions={{
                // consider the item names (as they are being shown)
                byPropertyName: true,
                // consider the "title" and "description" fields in the respective JSON Schema definitions
                fields: ["title", "description"]
            }}
        />
    </Story>
</Canvas>

----

### in property names
The `byPropertyName` prop allows you to toggle the search in item names on or off.
This can be combined with either `fields` or `filterBy`.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="in property names">
        <Inspector
            schemas={{
                Person: personSchema,
                Shop: shopSelectionSchema
            }}
            defaultSelectedItems={["Shop", "inventory", "[0]"]}
            searchOptions={{
                byPropertyName: true
            }}
        />
    </Story>
</Canvas>

----

### in schema fields
You can provide an array of `fields` in the JSON Schema (that are expected to contain strings) in which to search.
This can be combined with `byPropertyName`.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="in schema fields">
        <Inspector
            schemas={{
                Person: personSchema,
                Shop: shopSelectionSchema
            }}
            defaultSelectedItems={["Shop", "inventory", "[0]"]}
            searchOptions={{
                fields: ["description", "type"]
            }}
        />
    </Story>
</Canvas>

----

### per custom logic
You can also provide your own logic to `filterBy` on a given JS object representing a JSON Schema.
This can be combined with `byPropertyName` but replaces any defined `fields`.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="per custom logic">
        <Inspector
            schemas={{
                Person: personSchema,
                Shop: shopSelectionSchema
            }}
            defaultSelectedItems={["Shop", "inventory", "[0]"]}
            searchOptions={{
                // searching for sub-schemas containing a field matching the entered search term
                filterBy: (enteredSearchValue) => (rawSchema) => rawSchema[enteredSearchValue] !== undefined
            }}
        />
    </Story>
</Canvas>

----

### with custom placeholder
Via `inputPlaceholder` you can override the default "Search" hint in the input field with your own (e.g. translated) hint text.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="with custom placeholder">
        <Inspector
            schemas={{
                Person: personSchema,
                Shop: shopSelectionSchema
            }}
            defaultSelectedItems={["Shop", "inventory", "[0]"]}
            searchOptions={{
                fields: [],
                inputPlaceholder: "Enter something to searchâ€¦",
                byPropertyName: true
            }}
        />
    </Story>
</Canvas>

----

### with custom debounce
In order to avoid slowing down the user's browser while a search term is being entered, a debounce is being applied (i.e. not every change leads to a new search immediately).
By default, the search will be delayed for at least 200ms until nothing new is being entered or the maximum wait threshold of 500ms is being reached.
For exceptionally big schemas, you may want to increase these values to reduce the number of search executions.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="with custom debounce">
        <Inspector
            schemas={{
                Person: personSchema,
                Shop: shopSelectionSchema
            }}
            defaultSelectedItems={["Shop", "inventory", "[0]"]}
            searchOptions={{
                byPropertyName: true,
                // default: 200ms debounce while search term is being entered
                debounceWait: 500,
                // default: 500ms maximum debounce wait time until search is being triggered if term is still being entered
                debounceMaxWait: 2000
            }}
        />
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### disabled
You can also turn-off the search feature completely by providing `null` instead of an object to the whole `searchOptions` prop.


<Canvas>
    <Story name="disabled">
        <Inspector
            schemas={{
                Person: personSchema,
                Shop: shopSelectionSchema
            }}
            defaultSelectedItems={["Shop", "inventory", "[0]"]}
            // set to null to disable search completely
            searchOptions={null}
        />
    </Story>
</Canvas>
