Introducing a component for viewing/traversing (complex) JSON Schemas for the sake of documentation and potentially assisting users of a DSL in finding particular information in a custom data model.

## Demo

Check out the Storybook under: [https://carstenwickner.github.io/react-jsonschema-inspector](https://carstenwickner.github.io/react-jsonschema-inspector)

## Compatibility

This component is compatible with JSON Schema Draft 7.
It is also backwards-compatible with Drafts 4 and 6.

### Structural Properties

| Property | Support | Description |
| --- | --- |--- |
| `$schema` | - | *ignored* (assumed to be compatible to JSON Schema Draft 4, 6 or 7) |
| `$id` | Yes | allowed as sub-schema reference in `$ref` (as per Draft 6 and 7), but not displayed; *ignored* if specified anywhere but in the root schema or inside an entry in `definitions` |
| `id` | Yes | allowed as sub-schema reference in `$ref` (as per Draft 4), but not displayed; *ignored* if specified anywhere but in the root schema or inside an entry in `definitions` or if `$id` is present |
| `$ref` | Yes | used to look-up re-usable sub-schemas transparently (i.e. not displayed), supporting:<ul><li>`#` or the root `$id`/`id` value as root schema references,</li><li>`#/definitions/<name-of-definition>` or the respective `$id`/`id` value from within the `definitions` for sub-schemas,</li><li>absolute URIs are supported as long as those separate schemas are provided via the `referenceSchemas` prop (and their repesitve root `$id`/`id` matches the given `$ref`)</li><li>absolute URIs ending with `#/definitions/<name-of-definition>` are also provided via the `referenceSchemas` prop</li></ul> |
| `definitions`| Yes | used to provide re-usable sub-schemas that are being referenced via `$ref` (only in the respective root schemas) |
| `properties`| Yes | used to populate the whole structure to be traversed |
| `required` | Yes | used to add empty `properties` to structure if they are not also mentioned in `properties` directly |
| `additionalProperties` | - | *ignored* |
| `patternProperties` | - | *ignored* |
| `items`| Partially | used to look-up `properties` of single kind of items in an array; however if `items` is an array of multiple sub-schemas they are being *ignored* |
| `additionalItems`| Yes | used to look-up `properties` of kind of items in an array if `Ã¬tems` is not present or defined as an array (which is not supported itself), otherwise `additionalItems` are being *ignored* |
| `allOf` | Yes | used to combine sub-schemas transparently |
| `anyOf` | - | *ignored* |
| `oneOf` | - | *ignored* |
| `not` | - | *ignored* |
| `contains` | - | *ignored* |
| `dependencies` | - | *ignored* |
| `if` | - | *ignored* |
| `then` | - | *ignored* |
| `else` | - | *ignored* |

| `type` | Yes |  |
| `enum` | Yes | without further formatting |
| `const` | Yes | without further formatting |
| `minLength` | Yes |  |

| `pattern` | Yes |  |
| `format` | Yes | without further explanations |
| `multipleOf` | Yes |  |
| `minimum` | Yes |  |
| `exclusiveMinimum` | Yes | supported both as `number` per Draft 6 and 7 and `boolean` per Draft 4 |
| `maximum` | Yes |  |
| `exclusiveMaximum` | Yes | supported both as `number` per Draft 6 and 7 and `boolean` per Draft 4 |
| `required` | Yes | not on the individual items per default |
| `minItems` | Yes |  |
| `maxItems` | Yes |  |
| `uniqueItems` | Yes |  |
| `propertyNames` | - | *ignored* |
| `minProperties` | - | *ignored* |

## Usage

### Installation from NPM

```shell
npm i react-jsonschema-inspector
```

### React Component Props

| Prop | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `schemas` (required) | Object: keys will be displayed in the root column, the values are expected to be independent JSON Schema definitions (compatible to Draft 4, 6 or 7) |
| `referenceSchemas` | Array of objects: the entries are expected to be JSON Schema definitions with an absolute URI as `$id`/`id` (compatible to Draft 4, 6 or 7). These schemas will not be shown on the root column, but are used to resolve URI `$ref`erences in any of the displayed `schemas` or in another entry of the `referenceSchemas` |
| `defaultSelectedItems` | Array of strings: each referring to the name of the selected item in the respective column (i.e. the first entry in this array should match one key in the `schemas` object) |
| `onSelect` | Function: call-back being invoked after the selection changed. Receives three parameters: (1) the change event, (2) the selection - as per the `defaultSelectedItems`, (3) an object containing the "columnData" - the full render information for all  |
| `breadcrumbs` | Object: enabling the definition of options for the breadcrumbs feature in the footer (can be disabled by setting to `null`) |
| `breadcrumbs.prefix` | String: to be shown in front of the root selection (e.g. "//" or "./") |
| `breadcrumbs.separator` | String: to be shown in front of any non-root selection (e.g. "." or "/") |
| `breadcrumbs.arrayItemAccessor` | String: to be appended for any non-trailing selection that is an array (e.g. "[0]" or ".get(0)") |
| `breadcrumbs.preventNavigation` | Boolean: set to `true` in order to turn-off the default behaviour of discarding any following selections when double-clicking on a breadcrumbs item |
| `renderItemContent` | Function: custom render function for name of single property/sub-schema in a column. Receives one parameter: object with the following properties: "name", "hasNestedItems", "selected", "schema" |
| `renderSelectionDetails` | Function: custom render function for the "Details" block on the right for the single property/sub-schema being selected. Receives one parameter: object with the following properties: "itemSchema", "columnData", "selectionColumnIndex" |
| `renderEmptyDetails` | Function: custom render function for the "Details" block on the right if nothing is selected yet. Receives one parameter, which is an object with the "rootColumnSchemas" property, which holds the array of top-level schemas (as derived from the `schemas` prop and augmented by any given `referenceSchemas`)

## TODOs (work in progress)

- Introduce search functionality in header (after determining how search results could be displayed)
- support `oneOf` (if there is a nice/consistent way to do so)
- support `anyOf` (if there is a nice/consistent way to do so)
